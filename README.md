## üìå Additional Notes:
- **Memory Optimization**: To ensure smooth performance and prevent excessive memory consumption, the image processing is efficiently handled by converting the images to smaller numpy arrays and leveraging memory-efficient methods.
- **No Need to Reprocess Images**: Once the text is extracted, only the extracted text is searched when a keyword is entered, avoiding reprocessing the image.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements:
- **Multi-format Text Output**: Adding options to download the extracted text in **PDF**, **TXT**, or **JSON** format.
- **Customizable Languages**: Extend OCR support for additional languages.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Add features like image enhancement to improve OCR accuracy on poor-quality images.
